/**
 * @notice a library for efficiently setting epoch ranges as bitfields.
 * @dev solidity uses 8 bits as its smallest 'native' type, and working with these in arrays
 *      is expensive. This library relies on some assumptions about epochs:
 *      1. Active users in epoch t are active in epochs t + k => k = 1...., K (unless they deactivate)
 *      2. Deactivated users in epoch t remain deactivated until they reactivate
 *      3. The user of this library has an awareness of the current epoch
 *      4. Time moves strictly forward.
 *
 *      A bitfield is a 256 bit integer, indicating a user is active (1) or inactive (0) for epoch i.
 *
 *      Assuming a 1 month epoch, this allows us to store just over 21 years of activation history
 *      in a single storage slot.
 *
 *      Initialize the array when activating the user for the first time, indicating what epoch they have
 *      started from.
 *
 *      Activate or deactivate the user at specific epochs.
 *       - Activating will set all subsequent epochs to active (1)
 *       - Deactivating will set all subsequent epochs to inactive (0)
 *
 *      Check if a particular epoch is active or not using the `isActivated` function.
 *
 *      Finally, you can iterate back from the current epoch to check when was the last time the user
 *      is activated.
 *      Note: do not start from the last possible epoch (255) as 'activated' users will have all epochs by default
 *      set to active (1). Instead, start from the current epoch.
